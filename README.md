# Eldritch-Estates-Fields-of-Shadow
Wandering through the depths of a long-forgotten library. An old book falls as you walk past, and reflexively, you catch it. Brushing your hand over the ancient leather, the lettering is foreign and strange. You are then ripped from this plane and torn asunder. You awake in a dilapidated cabin, in a body that doesnâ€™t feel like yours.
